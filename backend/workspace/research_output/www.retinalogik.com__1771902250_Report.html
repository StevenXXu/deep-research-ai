                <h1>One-Liner</h1>
<p>RetinaLogik offers a portable, AI/VR-powered visual field testing solution, streamlining workflows and improving patient experience in eye care clinics.</p>
<h2>1. Problem &amp; Solution</h2>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Traditional visual field testing is cumbersome, requires dedicated space and trained technicians, and can be uncomfortable for patients, leading to workflow inefficiencies and potentially unreliable results. High global prevalence of preventable/treatable vision impairment exacerbates the need.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> RetinaLogik's RVF200 headset provides a portable, patient-friendly alternative for visual field testing. Leverages VR and AI to deliver a more comfortable and efficient testing experience with streamlined EMR integration. Claims of 30%+ faster clinic workflows, reduced space requirements, and enhanced patient comfort. Can perform 6+ core eye exams, multilingual support for diverse patients.</p>
<h2>2. Market Opportunity</h2>
<p><strong>Target Customer:</strong> Ophthalmologists, optometrists, and eye care clinics seeking to improve workflow efficiency, reduce costs, enhance patient experience, and leverage advanced diagnostic tools.</p>
<p><strong>Competition:</strong> Traditional perimetry devices (e.g., Humphrey Field Analyzer). Other VR-based vision testing solutions, although RetinaLogik touts superior reliability and user-friendliness based on testimonials.</p>
<p><strong>Market Size:</strong> Large and growing global market for vision care, driven by aging populations and increasing prevalence of eye diseases. Specific market size for portable visual field testing is harder to quantify but represents a significant subset of the overall ophthalmic diagnostics market, fueled by demand for efficient and patient-friendly solutions. WHO data indicates that over 2B people globally live with vision impairment.</p>
<h2>3. Traction &amp; Signals</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Funding:</strong> $3.67M total raised, including $783K pre-seed round led by HaloHealth (closed in early 2024). $1.1M raised 1 year ago.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Testimonials:</strong> Positive testimonials from optometrists and practice owners highlighting workflow improvements, patient satisfaction, EMR integration, and reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Research-Backed:</strong> University of Calgary spin-out with technology validated against gold standard, results published in peer-reviewed journals.</li>
<li><strong>Market Presence:</strong> Clinics in 5+ countries across 3 continents.</li>
<li><strong>Technician Satisfaction:</strong> Claims that 97% of technicians say RetinaLogik improves clinic space usage, enhances patient comfort, and reduces time-to-test. 95% of patients prefer RetinaLogik over traditional methods.</li>
<li><strong>Mosaic Score:</strong> Negative trend in the past 30 days (-12 points) potentially signals slowing momentum.</li>
<li><strong>Partnerships:</strong> Collaboration with Canadian ophthalmologists and optometrists, signals clinical validation and adoption.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>Bull:</strong> RetinaLogik addresses a clear pain point in visual field testing with a compelling, VR-based solution. Strong testimonials and research backing suggest a superior product. Focus on workflow efficiency and patient experience aligns with current market trends. Experienced founder from University of Calgary.</p>
<p><strong>Bear:</strong> Pre-seed stage carries significant risk. Negative Mosaic Score trend warrants further investigation. Competition in ophthalmic diagnostics is intense. Scalability and long-term efficacy of VR-based testing need to be proven. Small team size may hinder rapid expansion.</p>

# One-Liner
RetinaLogik offers a portable, VR-based visual field testing platform intended to replace traditional, cumbersome diagnostic equipment in optometry and ophthalmology clinics.

## 1. Problem & Solution
Traditional visual field testing is time-consuming, requires specialized space, and is often uncomfortable for patients, leading to workflow inefficiencies and potentially unreliable results. RetinaLogik solves this by offering a portable, patient-friendly VR headset (RVF200) that streamlines the testing process, improves patient comfort, and integrates directly into clinic workflows, reportedly boosting efficiency by over 30%. The platform supports multiple core eye exams, offers prompts in 35+ languages, and provides data designed to support clinical decision-making.

## 2. Market Opportunity
The target market includes ophthalmologists, optometrists, and eye care clinics globally. Competitors include traditional visual field testing equipment manufacturers (e.g., Zeiss, Humphrey) and emerging VR-based diagnostic companies. The market opportunity is substantial, driven by the increasing prevalence of vision impairment and the growing demand for efficient and patient-friendly diagnostic tools. The WHO estimates over two billion people live with vision impairment, with at least half of these cases being preventable or treatable. RetinaLogik claims to be in 5+ countries across 3 continents.
